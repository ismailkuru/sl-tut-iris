(** * Separation Logic *)

(**
Separation logic is an extension of Hoare logic. We can use it to reason about program with pointer --
or more generally, one type of value that serves as a reference to another value in memory.

Separation logic is developed by John C. Reynolds et al. at the start of this century. It is still being
studied, extended, and revised actively today.
